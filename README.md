# forex-miner-sif

Implementation of the frontend in the forex-miner application. The repo's name is coming from the Norse mythology, in which [Sif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sif) is a goddess associated with Earth and the wife of the thunder god Thor.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to build, run etc.
- A browser for development, preferably one which supports [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) development with some tooling, e.g.: Chrome, Edge - Chromium based
- An IDE for development, recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as there are launch configurations stored for it under the folder `.vscode` in this repo 

### Run, test, build

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
